# Visual Studio Code Language Packs

This repository contains files to build localized Language Pack extensions for Visual Studio Code. A Language Pack contains the localized string resources for a particular language. 

Localized resource files are managed and edited in Microsoft Localization Community. Files will be exported to this repository when prepare the publishing of language pack.

Language pack extensions are published to the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Language%20Packs&sortBy=Installs)

There are 13 "Core" languages for Visual Studio Code.
Previous 3 additional community driven languages are putting on hold while we are looking for the way how community can contribute.

## Why this project exists?
I am using VSCodium for some reasons, but VSCodium don't use Microsoft's Marketplace due possible to legal problems. So I forked this project and ported into a VSCodium Extension. I don't do any modification, even this file, I just add the lines to explain why I do this, it is just for having a localized user interface when I using VSCodium to create this project. Thanks to Microsoft and other people's kindness work can I use such a good IDE. I send my truely thanks to them.
## Notice: 
Microsoft  has updated a official version([Here](https://open-vsx.org/extension/MS-CEINTL/vscode-language-pack-zh-hans)), I recommend you use this one instead mine.
