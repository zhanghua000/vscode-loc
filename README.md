# Visual Studio Code Language Packs

This repository contains all of the localized Language Pack extensions for Visual Studio Code. A Language Pack contains the localized string resources for a particular language. 

Localized resource files are managed in [Microsoft Localization Community Platform (MLCP)](https://envelope-community.azurewebsites.net/).

There are 13 "Core" languages for Visual Studio Code and, currently, 3 additional community driven languages:  

|Language|Visual Studio Code Language ID|MLCP Language Code|Type|

## Contributing Translations

Visual Studio Code translations are done in the [Visual Studio Code Project in MLCP](https://aka.ms/vscodeloc). MLCP is the single source of "truth", therefore any changes need to be made there. This repository is for building the language pack extensions.

## Why this project exists?
I am using VSCodium for some reasons, but VSCodium don't use Microsoft's Marketplace due possible to legal problems. So I forked this project and ported into a VSCodium Extension. I don't do any modification, even this file, I just add the lines to explain why I do this, it is just for having a localized user interface when I using VSCodium to create this project. Thanks to Microsoft and other people's kindness work can I use such a good IDE. I send my truely thanks to them.
